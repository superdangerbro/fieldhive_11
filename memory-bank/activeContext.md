# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initial project setup and foundation laying

## Code Preservation Rules
- Never overwrite or completely rewrite existing components without explicit user confirmation
- Ask for permission to save current work before making significant changes
- Preserve unrelated functionality when updating components
- Get explicit confirmation before making major component modifications
- When working on a specific feature, avoid modifying unrelated code
- Document any necessary component rewrites in the commit message
- Keep a backup of critical components before major changes

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank structure
- Defined project requirements
- Established technical architecture
- Documented system patterns
- Set up development context

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. Using PWA for offline-first approach
2. PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data
3. React + Material-UI for frontend
4. Node.js + Express for backend
5. Mapbox GL JS for mapping features

### Current Considerations
1. Form builder architecture
2. Offline sync strategy
3. Map feature editing UX
4. Floor plan overlay implementation
5. Data validation approach

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Set up project repository
2. Initialize frontend PWA
3. Set up backend API structure
4. Configure database with PostGIS
5. Implement basic authentication

### Short-term Goals
1. Create basic form builder
2. Implement map feature creation
3. Set up offline storage
4. Develop sync mechanism
5. Create basic reporting

### Technical Debt
- None yet - greenfield project

## Open Questions
1. Preferred floor plan format
2. Specific form field types needed
3. Required report formats
4. Data retention requirements
5. Backup frequency requirements

## Current Blockers
- None identified yet

## Recent Learnings
- Project requirements documented
- Technical stack defined
- Architecture patterns established

## Team Focus
- Setting up development environment
- Establishing coding standards
- Creating initial prototypes
